Assignment 2 - Vibrations of fractal drums.
This code looks at the vibrations of fractal drums. For each order of the fractals, L, there is made a new
lattice. The lattice points inside, outside and on the border of the fractal is calculated by two different methods,
and the runtime is very different. Furthermore, the eigenfrequencies of the fractal drums, and their corresponding
eigenmodes are calculated.
